# movie_review
The objective is to scrap all helpful reviews of a movie/series from the IMDB. Make a cleaner version out of all the reviews by performing basic NLP cleaning steps
such as stemming, removing all stop words and so on.
Finally create a word cloud to get a sense about the movie by just looking at it.
